# Stacks & Queues

## What is a Stack?

- It's a data structure that consists of Nodes.

## Concepts:

FILO: First In Last Out 

- First item added in stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

LIFO: Last In First Out

- Last item added in stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## Stack Terminology:

"
- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- Top - This is the top of the stack.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

## Queue Concepts:

FIFO: First In First Out

- First item in the queue will be the first item out.

LILO:
