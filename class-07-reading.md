# Express

## What is Express... middleware?

- It's a series of functions that have access to and can modify the request and response cycle in an app.
-  Such modifications include:

" Execute any code
  Make changes to the request and the response objects.
  End the request-response cycle.
  Call the next middleware function in the stack."
