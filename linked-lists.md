# Implementation: Linked Lists

## What is a linked list?

- It's a sequence of Nodes connected to each other. 
- There are two types: singly and doubly.
- The memory of a linked list can be scattered throughout instead of being concentrated in one spot, 
   while arrays need to take up that one spot of memory.
   
 - A linked list is considered a dynamic data structure.
 - This means that it can grow and shrink in memory and how much memory it needs.
 
 ## Parts of a linked list
 
 - It's made up of nodes.
 - The first node is called the head, which is the entry point to the list and its elements.
 - The end of the list is made of a node that leads to null, which is an empty value. 
 - Within a single node, you can find the data and a reference to the next node.
